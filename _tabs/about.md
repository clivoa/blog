My name is Caio, and I work in Information Security with a focus on defensive operations, threat analysis, and continuous learning.

Over the years, I have been involved in investigations, hands-on labs, certifications, and practical security challenges. I am particularly interested in understanding how attacks unfold — not only from a technical perspective, but from an analytical and strategic one.

I believe cybersecurity is a discipline that demands curiosity, consistency, and humility. There is always something new to learn, refine, or question.

Outside of work and study, I am simply someone who enjoys building, testing, breaking, and understanding how systems really work.
