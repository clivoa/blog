I have been working in Information Security for several years. Between investigations, training sessions, studies, labs, and certifications, I realized that I learn best when I organize my ideas — and even more when I share what I am learning. It is not always easy. Sometimes procrastination wins. This blog is the space where I document this journey: notes on technology, cybersecurity, certifications, CTFs, and everything that orbits this universe.
